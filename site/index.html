    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>this is some minor change to see whether i got this commit and push thing down</p>
    <p>here is some more text to see whether our browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*" command worked.</p>
    <p>and in fact it did, and it's quite impressive. What it does is, whenever i edit this file in Atom (or any other texteditor)
       it will update my browser as soon as I save this document.</p>
    <p>what a time saver</p>
